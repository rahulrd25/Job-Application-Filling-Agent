# JobFill Pro: Intelligent Job Application Agent

JobFill Pro is a high-performance browser extension and backend system designed to eliminate the friction of job applications. It combines **deterministic business logic** for standard data with **Llama 3.3 Intelligence** for creative, human-sounding cover letters and application essays.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Universal Form Detection**: Built-in "Teleport" engine that scans complex web structures, including **cross-origin iframes** (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday) and accessibility-first elements (`aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`).
*   **Hybrid Intelligence Agent**:
    *   **Deterministic Matching**: 100% accuracy for factual data (Phone, Email, LinkedIn, Work Authorization) using stabilized keyword heuristics.
    *   **Groq-Powered Creativity**: Auto-generates tailored responses for "Why this company?", "Tell us about your experience," and Cover Letters using Groq's low-latency Llama-3.3-70B model.
*   **Zero AI-Slop Philosophy**: The AI agent is strictly tuned to avoid corporate jargon, buzzwords, and "ChatGPT-isms," producing direct, grounded, and human-to-human responses.
*   **Multi-tenant Airtable Integration**: Secure, cloud-synced profile management utilizing Airtable as a robust backend.
*   **Cyber-Yellow Pro UI**: A high-productivity, high-contrast dashboard with dynamic resizing (popups automatically expand to 500px for questionnaire sessions).

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### 1. Backend (Python/FastAPI)
Acts as the "Central Brain" of the system:
- **Field Matcher**: A prioritized keyword engine that resolves form field intents.
- **Intelligence Agent**: Orchestrates LLM calls to Groq with sophisticated system prompting to ensure human-like tone and JD matching.
- **Airtable Client**: Manages the EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) storage schema for user profiles.

### 2. Extension (React/TypeScript/Vite)
The "Eyes and Hands" in the browser:
- **Scripting Engine**: Uses `chrome.scripting` to execute synchronous scans across every frame in the browser tab.
- **Dynamic Popup Manager**: React-based UI that handles state transitions between the dashboard and complex onboarding questionnaires.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

cd backend
# Install dependencies using uv
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file in `/backend`:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your_pat_token
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_base_id
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=jobfilling_Data
```

### 2. Airtable Setup
Follow the [Detailed Airtable Guide](./AIRTABLE_SETUP.md) to configure your columns.

### 3. Extension build
```bash
cd extension
npm install
npm run build

## 📖 Usage Guide

1.  **Setup Profile**: Click the extension icon and follow the questionnaire. Fill out the **🚀 Experience & Pitch** section—this is the "source of truth" the AI uses to write your cover letters.
2.  **Scan \& Match**: Navigate to any job application. Click **Scan Application**. The agent will identify all fields, even those hidden in iframes.
3.  **Fill**: Click **Fill Application**. Standard data is mapped instantly, and creative fields are generated by Groq in real-time.
4.  **Review**: Final human review is always recommended before submission.
